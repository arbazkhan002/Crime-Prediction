====================DATA GENERATION FILES================
datagenerator.py:
	This is the template code using which all the other "gridbased*.py" files are made. These files are used for data generation on which later matlab files run to get the results.
gridbasedTimeDiv.py:
	This file aggregates the data into number of crime incidents corresponding to the month and a particular hour of the day.
gridbased.py:
	Divides data recording the last 3 months data for each particulat month.
gridbased_t4.py:
	Divides data recording the last 4 months data for each particulat month.
gridbased_t9.py:
	Divides data recording the last 9 months data for each particulat month.
withinacolumn.py:
	Find lift measure between two entities in a columnwise file

=====================MATLAB FILES========================
monthly_main.m:
	This is the template code using which all the other "monthly_*.m" files are made. These files take input from the data generated by the above mentioned python files.
	The output is the combination of graphs for each grid cell and aggregated results of accuracy and performance for each run.
	
monthly_hourly_t3.m:
	This piece of matlab code analyzes and computes the results of the analysis for the case in which we are considering the effect of the last 3 months with the particular hour of the day also taken in account.
	t3 represents that the algorithm uses the data of last 3 months to predict crimes this month.

monthly_nothourly_t3.m:
	This piece of matlab code analyzes and computes the results of the analysis for the case in which we are considering the effect of the last 3 months.
	The difference with the above file is that it does not take into account the hourwise distribution of crime.
	Rather the crimes for the whole day is aggregated to one count.
	t3 represents that the algorithm uses the data of last 3 months to predict crimes this month.

monthly_nothourly_t4.m:
	This piece of matlab code analyzes and computes the results of the analysis for the case in which we are considering the effect of the last 4 months.
	The difference with the file "monthly_hourly_t3.m" is that it does not take into account the hourwise distribution of crime.
	Rather the crimes for the whole day is aggregated to one count.
	t4 represents that the algorithm uses the data of last 4 months to predict crimes this month.

monthly_nothourly_t9.m:
	This piece of matlab code analyzes and computes the results of the analysis for the case in which we are considering the effect of the last 9 months.
	The difference with the file "monthly_hourly_t3.m" is that it does not take into account the hourwise distribution of crime.
	Rather the crimes for the whole day is aggregated to one count.
	t9 represents that the algorithm uses the data of last 9 months to predict crimes this month.

======================RESULTS============================

-The 3 pdf files contain the results as obtained after performing the above mentioned data mining operations.
-Some of the results/graphs are contained in the folder "Results"
-Note: Similar results were obtained for all grid cells in all the above mentioned scenarios.
